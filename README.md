## List01

  You will be given a list of fruits. Add x fruit to it from the end and return.

**Example 1:**

```Python
Input: fruits = ["apple", "banana"] x = 'kiwi'
Output: ["apple", "banana", "kiwi"]

```

**Constraints:**

  - 1 <= length(fruits) <= 10^5

## List02

  You will be given a list of fruits. Add the x fruit to the i index and return it.

**Example 1:**

```Python
Input: fruits = ["apple", "banana"] x = 'kiwi' i=1
Output: ["apple", "kiwi", "banana"]

```

**Constraints:**

  - 1 <= length(fruits) <= 10^5
  - 0 <= i < length(fruits)

## List03

  You will be given a list of several fruits called fruits1 and fruits2. Return the result by adding the second to the first list.

**Example 1:**

```Python
Input: fruits1 = ["apple", "banana"] fruits2 = ["kiwi", "pear"]
Output: ["apple", "banana", "kiwi", "pear"]

```

**Constraints:**

  - 1 <= length(fruits1) <= 10^5
  - 1 <= length(fruits2) <= 10^5

## List04

  You are given a list of numbers. i Delete and return the number in the index.

**Example 1:**

```Python
Input: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] i = 2
Output: 3

```

**Example 2:**

```Python
Input: numbers = [4, 7, 3, 2, 8] i = 4
Output: 8

```

**Constraints:**

  - 1 <= length(numbers) <= 10^5
  - 0 <= i < length(numbers)

## List05

  You are given a list called numbers1 and numbers2.
  Delete the last item in the first list and add that deleted item to the beginning of the second list.
  Merge the first list into the second and return.

**Example 1:**

```Python
Input: numbers1 = [6, 8, 1] numbers2 = [3, 5, 7]
Output: [6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7]

```

**Constraints:**

  - 1 <= length(numbers1) <= 10^5
  - 1 <= length(numbers2) <= 10^5

## List06

  Given a list called Fruits, it contains at least one apple. Find how many apples are on the list and return.

**Example 1:**

```Python
Input: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "pear"]
Output: 2

```

**Example 2:**

```Python
Input: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "apple", "apple]
Output: 4

```

**Constraints:**

  - 1 <= length(fruits) <= 10^5

## List07

  A list of zeros and ones is given. Find how many zeros are involved and return.

**Example 1:**

```Python
Input: list1 = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]
Output: 2

```

**Example 2:**

```Python
Input: fruits = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: 7

```

**Constraints:**

  - 1 <= length(list1) <= 10^5

## List08

  A list called "fruits" is given and is five in length and contains at least one "apple". Remove the apples from the list and return the list.

**Example 1:**

```Python
Input: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "pear", "apple"]
Output: ["banana", "pear"]

```

**Example 2:**

```Python
Input: fruits = ["apple", "apple", "apple", "apple", "kiwi"]
Output: ["kiwi"]

```

**Constraints:**

  - length(fruits) == 5

## List09

  A list called “fruits” is given and is five in length and contains at least one “apple”. Calculate how many “apple” were involved and return the indexes in a list view.

**Example 1:**

```Python
Input: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "pear", "apple"]
Output: [3, 0, 2, 4]

```

**Example 2:**

```Python
Input: fruits = ["apple", "apple", "apple", "apple", "kiwi"]
Output: [4, 0, 1, 2, 3]

```

**Constraints:**

  - length(fruits) == 5

## List10

  A list of zeros and ones is given. Find how many ones and how many zeros there are and return to the list form.

**Example 1:**

```Python
Input: list1 = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
Output: [3, 5]

```

**Example 2:**

```Python
Input: list1 = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
Output: [4, 7]

```

**Constraints:**

  - 1 <= length(list1) <= 10^5
